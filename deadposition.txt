Lichess (and other chess pages) haven't implemented properly law 5.2.2 of chess,
let's remember what it said:

'The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can
checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said
to end in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the
move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles
4.2 – 4.7.'.

- [] = This hasn't been implemented in the program yet.
- [] = This has been implemented in the program.
? = We don't know if this can happen or not
IMPOSSIBLE = We know it's IMPOSSIBLE
An example = We know it's possible

Sometimes I'm going to make a list of pieces using the initial of the pieces,
in uppercase for white and in lowercase for black, however it's necessary to
modify this rule, (n)K means any number of white knights, LB stands for a light
colored bishop owned by white and DB stands for dark colored bishop owned by
black. B stands for any bishop owned by white.

Let's try to determine insufficient material possibilities for one side:

SECTION 1 Insufficient material

- [] Insufficient material. (This are all possibilities that make checkmating
impossible for both sides)
  - [] Kk
  - [] KNk
  - [] King and any number of same colored bishop versus king and any number of
  same colored bishops also of the same color than the first ones.

Now it's very easy to determine that type of draw, now we have to deal with
harder ones:

SECTION 2 No one can make progress
- [] King and pawns blocked with other pawns and divide the board in two parts
with a barrier that the kings cannot cross, and they are on the side where
they cannot take any piece. 8/1k6/1p1p1p1p/pPpPpPpP/P1P1P1P1/8/5K2/8 w - - 0 1
- [] The same as the last example but also with any number of same colored
bishops that are trapped in their kings respective site and cannot be taken or
take any pawn in any position they could reach.
8/1k2b3/1p1p1p1p/pPpPpPpP/P1P1P1P1/1B6/5K2/8 w - - 0 1
- [] Other examples in Examples/type1.txt
What do they have in common:
  - No side can make progress.
  - All the pieces are blocked or trapped.
  - No piece can capture another piece.

SECTION 3 Derivate dead draws
Let's call positions in SECTION 1 and 2 basic dead draws, now we have to work
with mixes with them or stalemate.
SECTION 3.1
- [] A position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1
If before the move we weren't in section 1, that means the move we're forced to
do is a capture, and that means that the position without one of the pieces I
am forced to capture is draw, that means that there are three cases and mixes.
  - [] The position we're forced to reach is Kk
  If it comes from a position that wasn't already in SECTION 1 that means we're
  forced to capture a queen, a rook or a pawn and there's one possible move:
    - [] Queen (Needs check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K7 w - - 0 1
    - [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K7 w - - 0 1
    - [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE
  - [] The position we're forced to reach is KNk or Kkn
    - The position we're forced to reach is KNk, we're forced to take:
      - [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE (Knight can always move)
      - [] Knight IMPOSSIBLE (Knight can move, king can move, or it's immediate
      checkmate)
      - [] Bishop (Needs check) 8/8/8/8/8/1kb5/8/KN6 w - - 0 1
      - [] Rook (Needs check) 7N/8/8/8/8/3k4/8/3Kr3 w - - 0 1
      - [] Queen (Needs check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K6N w - - 0 1
    - The position we're forced to reach is Kkn, we're forced to take:
      - [] Pawn (Doesn't need check) 3k4/8/8/8/3n4/8/3p4/3K4 w - - 0 1
      - [] Knight (Doesn't need check) 7n/8/8/8/8/k7/8/Kn6 w - - 0 1
      - [] Bishop (Doesn't need check) 7n/8/8/8/8/k7/8/Kb6 w - - 0 1
      - [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K6n w - - 0 1
      - [] Queen (Needs check) 7n/8/8/8/8/8/6q1/k6K w - - 0 1
  - [] The position we're forced to reach is King and any number of same colored
  bishop versus king and any number of same colored bishops also of the same
  color than the first ones.
    - [] We don't have any bishops
      - [] Pawn (Doesn't need check) k7/8/8/8/8/4b3/4p3/4K3 w - - 0 1
      - [] Knight (Doesn't need check) 8/8/8/8/8/5b2/4k2n/6K1 w - - 0 1
      - [] Other colored bishop (Doesn't need check)
      8/8/8/8/8/8/5k1b/b6K w - - 0 1
      - [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 6bk/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K7 w - - 0 1
      - [] Queen (Needs check) 6bk/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K7 w - - 0 1
    - [] We have at least one bishop
      - [] Pawn (Doesn't need check)

      - [] Queen (Doesn't need check)

  - [] Mixes (we can choose between two or more pieces)
    - [] Kknn (Doesn't need check) 8/8/8/8/8/k7/2n5/1Kn5 w - - 0 1
    - [] Kknb (Doesn't need check) 8/8/8/8/8/8/nb6/1K1k4 w - - 0 1
    - [] Kkbb
      - [] IMPOSSIBLE it would be already a draw.
      - [] Different color (Needs check) 8/8/8/8/8/8/bb6/1K1k4 w - - 0 1
    - [] Kk and more bishops
      - [] If white has bishops they have to be all of the same color and there
      must be only one more different colored bishop that is going to be
      captured by the king on the next turn, that means there is one possible
      move and that doesn't fit on this section.
      - [] If black had more than two bishops then there must be only on bishop
      on light or dark squares, that means that it would have to be captured by
      the king on the next move and there wouldn't be more than one option to
      capture, so that wouldn't fit on this section.
      - [] Kk and knights and bishops ?
SECTION 3.2
- [] A position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 2 ?
SECTION 3.3
- [] A position where every move leads to a draw by stalemate ?

- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1 or 2 where
 doesn't
matter who has to move. ?
SECTION 3.5
- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1 or
stalemate ?
SECTION 3.6
- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 2 or
