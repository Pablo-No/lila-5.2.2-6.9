Lichess (and other chess pages) haven't implemented properly law 5.2.2 of chess,
let's remember what it said:

'The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can
checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said
to end in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the
move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles
4.2 – 4.7.'.

- [] = This hasn't been implemented in the program yet.
- [] = This has been implemented in the program.
? = We don't know if this can happen or not
IMPOSSIBLE = We know it's IMPOSSIBLE
An example = We know it's possible

Let's try to determine insufficient material possibilities for one side:

SECTION 1 Insufficient material

- [] Insufficient material. (This are all possibilities that make checkmating
impossible for both sides)
  - [] Kk
  - [] KNk
  - [] King and any number of same colored bishop versus king and any number of
  same colored bishops also of the same color than the first ones.

Now it's very easy to determine that type of draw, now we have to deal with
harder ones:

SECTION 2 No one can make progress
- [] King and pawns blocked with other pawns and divide the board in two parts
with a barrier that the kings cannot cross, and they are on the side where
they cannot take any piece. 8/1k6/1p1p1p1p/pPpPpPpP/P1P1P1P1/8/5K2/8 w - - 0 1
- [] The same as the last example but also with any number of same colored
bishops that are trapped in their kings respective site and cannot be taken or
take any pawn in any position they could reach.
8/1k2b3/1p1p1p1p/pPpPpPpP/P1P1P1P1/1B6/5K2/8 w - - 0 1
- [] Other examples in Examples/type1.txt
What do they have in common:
  - No side can make progress.
  - All the pieces are blocked or trapped.
  - No piece can capture another piece.

SECTION 3 Derivate dead draws
Let's call positions in SECTION 1 and 2 basic dead draws, now we have to work
with mixes with them or stalemate.
- [] A position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1
If before the move we weren't in section 1, that means the move we're forced to
do is a capture, and that means that the position without one of the pieces I
am forced to capture is draw, that means that there are three cases.
  - [] The position we're forced to reach is Kk
  If it comes from a position that wasn't already in SECTION 1 that means we're
  forced to capture a queen, a rook or a pawn and there's one possible move:
    - [] Queen (Needs check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K7 w - - 0 1
    - [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K7 w - - 0 1
    - [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE
  - [] The position we're forced to reach is KNk or Kkn
    - The position we're forced to reach is KNk, we're forced to take:
      - [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE (Knight can always move)
      - [] Knight IMPOSSIBLE (Knight can move, king can move, or it's immediate
      checkmate)
      - [] Bishop (Needs check) 8/8/8/8/8/1kb5/8/KN6 w - - 0 1
      - [] Rook (Needs check) 7N/8/8/8/8/3k4/8/3Kr3 w - - 0 1
      - [] Queen (Needs check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K6N w - - 0 1
    - The position we're forced to reach is KNk, we're forced to take:
      - [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE ?
      - [] Knight IMPOSSIBLE ?
      - [] Bishop (Needs check) ?
      - [] Rook (Needs check) ?
      - [] Queen (Needs check) ?
- [] A position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 2 ?
- [] A position where every move leads to a draw by stalemate ?
- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1 or 2 where doesn't
matter who has to move. ?
- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1 or stalemate ?
- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 2 or stalemate ?
- [] Any position where every move leads to any position in SECTION 1, 2 or stalemate ?
