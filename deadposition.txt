Lichess (and other chess pages) haven't implemented properly law 5.2.2 of chess,
let's remember what it said:

'The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can
checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said
to end in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the
move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles
4.2 – 4.7.'.

- [] = This hasn't been implemented in the program yet.
- [] = This has been implemented in the program.
? = We don't know if this can happen or not
IMPOSSIBLE = We know it's IMPOSSIBLE
An example = We know it's possible

Let's try to determine insufficient material possibilities for one side:

SECTION 1
- [] One opponent cannot checkmate other because he/she doesn't have enough
pieces to do it, this possibilities are simple to implement, let's make a list
about the material that the side we are checking and the opponent, as
sometimes if he/she has material, it's possible to checkmate:
  - [] King
  - [] King and Knight only if the opponent hasn't got:
    - [] At least one pawn (It could promote to a knight and finish like this
    6nk/5N2/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1) (In this an all example the opponent has
    to also have insufficient material to work) (If there was an immediate
    stalemate it won't affect us, because we're looking for forced draws)
    - [] At least one bishop 6bk/8/6NK/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
    - [] At least one knight 6nk/5N2/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
    - [] At least one rook 6rk/5N2/7K/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
    - At least one queen INCORRECT, you cannot checkmate the opponent if
    he/she has a queen.
  - [] King any number of same colored bishops only if the opponent hasn't
  got:
    - [] At least one pawn (It could promote to a knight and finish like this
    6nk/6B1/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1)
    - [] At least one opposite colored bishop 6bk/6B1/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
    - Any number of same colored bishops INCORRECT, a king always have at
    least two squares with the opposite color that the square in which it's
    placed, in order to checkmate him the king has to be on a square on the
    same color as the two bishops, so the enemy king could scape through two
    squares, one can be controlled by our king, but the other can't be
    controlled or occupied by any piece on the board.
    - [] At least one rook 6rk/8/5B1K/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
    - Any number of queens INCORRECT, you cannot checkmate the opponent if he
    or she has a queen.

This includes more possibilities, but insufficient material draw only happens
when both players have insufficient material, so I'll try to resume
possibilities for both sides.

- Kk
- KNk
- King and any number of same colored bishop versus king and any number of
same colored bishops also of the same color than the first ones.

Now it's very easy to determine that type of draw, now we have to deal with
harder ones:

SECTION 2
- [] King and pawns blocked with other pawns and divide the board in two parts
with a barrier that the kings cannot cross, and they are on the side where
they cannot take any piece. 8/1k6/1p1p1p1p/pPpPpPpP/P1P1P1P1/8/5K2/8 w - - 0 1
- [] The same as the last example but also with any number of same colored
bishops that are trapped in their kings respective site and cannot be taken or
take any pawn in any position they could reach.
8/1k2b3/1p1p1p1p/pPpPpPpP/P1P1P1P1/1B6/5K2/8 w - - 0 1
- [] Other examples in Examples/type1.txt
What do they have in common:
  - No side can make progress.
  - All the pieces are blocked or trapped.
  - No piece can capture another piece.
SECTION 3
- [] Any position that leads to any position in SECTION 1 or 2 where doesn't
matter who has to move. ?
What does that imply:
  - No side can be on check because that would imply one side cannot have the
  move, but we said 'Any position [...] where doesn't matter who has to move'


This is easy to implement, we can call all draws we've seen before these types
of draw basic dead draw, because in them it doesn't matter who has the move,
now we have to deal with other types of draws:

- [] A position where any move leads to a basic dead draw or a draw by stalemate

Is this possible, yes, there are many examples of that while being on check,
