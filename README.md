# Lila 5.2.2 and 6.9
I'm going to create this project to help lichess and anyone who reads this project to identify all possible ways for a position to be a draw under FIDE laws of chess 5.2.2 and 6.9.
I hope this document helps to identify all of this drawn possitions.
I'll make my reasonings in simplification.md.
