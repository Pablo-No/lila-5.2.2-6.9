# Lila 5.2.2 and 6.9
I'm going to create this project to help lichess and anyone who reads this project to identify all possible ways for a position to be a draw under FIDE laws of chess 5.2.2 and 6.9.
I hope this document helps to identify all of this drawn positions.
I'll make my reasonings in simplification.md.
First I'm going to think only on legal positions, but then I'm going to try to expand this to all positions on a chess board.
