Lichess (and other chess pages) haven't implemented properly law 5.2.2 of chess,
let's remember what it said:

'The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can
checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said
to end in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the
move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles
4.2 – 4.7.'.

There are only two draw possibilities that are forced
  -Forced draw by 75 moves rule
  -Forced stalemate
So that reduces possibilities

- [] = This hasn't been implemented in the program yet.
- [] = This has been implemented in the program.
? = We don't know if this can happen or not
IMPOSSIBLE = We know it's IMPOSSIBLE
An example = We know it's possible

Sometimes I'm going to make a list of pieces using the initial of the pieces,
in uppercase for white and in lowercase for black, however it's necessary to
modify this rule, (n)K means any number of white knights, LB stands for a light
colored bishop owned by white and DB stands for dark colored bishop owned by
black. B stands for any bishop owned by white.

Let's try to determine insufficient material possibilities where our side has
the move:

-1 [] Positions where every sequence of moves leads to draw by 75 move rule
  -1 [] Insufficient material (means that with that material in any position you
  can't checkmate)
    -1 [] Kk
  -2 [] Blocked positions (where stalemate isn't possible)
    -1 [] There are no possible captures and only king can move.
    -2 [] There are no possible captures and at least one piece other than king
    can move.
    -3 [] There are possible captures
    -4 [] Positions with lead either to 1.2.1, 1.2.2 or 1.2.3
    - Until we prove 1.1.4 to exist we can't go further
  -3 [] Positions with lead only to 1.1
  If it comes from a position that wasn't already in SECTION 1 that means we're
  forced to capture a queen, a rook or a pawn and there's one possible move:
    -1 [] Queen (Needs check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K7 w - - 0 1
    -2 [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K7 w - - 0 1
    -3 [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE
  -2 [] The position we're forced to reach is KNk or Kkn
    -1 The position we're forced to reach is KNk, we're forced to take:
      -1 [] Pawn IMPOSSIBLE (Knight can always move)
      -2 [] Knight IMPOSSIBLE (Knight can move, king can move, or it's immediate
      checkmate)
      -3 [] Bishop (Needs check) 8/8/8/8/8/1kb5/8/KN6 w - - 0 1
      -4 [] Rook (Needs check) 7N/8/8/8/8/3k4/8/3Kr3 w - - 0 1
      -5 [] Queen (Needs check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K6N w - - 0 1
    -3 The position we're forced to reach is Kkn, we're forced to take:
      -1 [] Pawn (Doesn't need check) 3k4/8/8/8/3n4/8/3p4/3K4 w - - 0 1
      -2 [] Knight (Doesn't need check) 7n/8/8/8/8/k7/8/Kn6 w - - 0 1
      -3 [] Bishop (Doesn't need check) 7n/8/8/8/8/k7/8/Kb6 w - - 0 1
      -4 [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 7k/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K6n w - - 0 1
      -5 [] Queen (Needs check) 7n/8/8/8/8/8/6q1/k6K w - - 0 1
  -4 [] Positions that lead to 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 but not need necessarily to lead
  to the three.
  - Until we prove 1.4 to exist we can't go further
-2 [] Positions where every sequence of moves leads to draw by stalemate.
  -1 [] The last move is forced to be a capture.
  -2 [] The last move is not forced to be a capture.
  - Until we prove 2.2 to exist we can't go further
-3 [] Positions where every sequence of moves leads to draw by 75 move rule or
stalemate
  -1 [] Insufficient material (means that with that material in any position you
  can't checkmate)
    -2 [] KNk
    -3 [] King and any number of same colored bishop versus king and any number
    of same colored bishops also of the same color than the first ones.
  -2 [] Blocked positions (where stalemate is possible)
  -3 [] Positions that lead to 3.1
    -1 [] The position we're forced to reach is King and any number of same colored
    bishop versus king and any number of same colored bishops also of the same
    color than the first ones.
      -1 [] We don't have any bishops
        -1 [] Pawn (Doesn't need check) k7/8/8/8/8/4b3/4p3/4K3 w - - 0 1
        -2 [] Knight (Doesn't need check) 8/8/8/8/8/5b2/4k2n/6K1 w - - 0 1
        -3 [] Other colored bishop (Doesn't need check)
        8/8/8/8/8/8/5k1b/b6K w - - 0 1
        -4 [] Rook (Doesn't need check) 6bk/8/8/8/8/8/1r6/K7 w - - 0 1
        -5 [] Queen (Needs check) 6bk/8/8/8/8/8/1q6/K7 w - - 0 1
      -2 [] We have at least one bishop
        -1 [] Pawn (Doesn't need check)

    -1 [] Mixes (we can choose between capturing two or more pieces)
      -1 [] Kknn (Doesn't need check) 8/8/8/8/8/k7/2n5/1Kn5 w - - 0 1
      -2 [] Kknb (Doesn't need check) 8/8/8/8/8/8/nb6/1K1k4 w - - 0 1
      -3 [] Kkbb
        -1 [] Same color IMPOSSIBLE it would be already a draw.
        -2 [] Different color (Needs check) 8/8/8/8/8/8/bb6/1K1k4 w - - 0 1
      -4 [] Kk and more bishops
        -1 If we have bishops they have to be all of the same color and there
        must be only one more different colored bishop that is going to be
        captured by the king on the next turn, that means there is one possible
        move and that doesn't fit on this section. IMPOSSIBLE
        -2 If the opponent had more than two bishops then there must be only one
        bishop on light or dark squares, that means that it would have to be
        captured by the king on the next move and there wouldn't be more than one
        option to capture, so that wouldn't fit on this section. IMPOSSIBLE
     -3 Kk and knight(s) and bishops of the opponent: IMPOSSIBLE
        -1 We don't have pieces: If the opponent has at least a knight
        and a bishop, he can checkmate us, all the bishops must be same colored,
        because if not with bishops and knights we wouldn't be able to capture a
        piece making draw in the next turn. If there are more than one bishop, we
        would have to capture the knight and as there would be only one possible
        move it wouldn't belong to this section. IMPOSSIBLE
        -2 We have at least one piece (except all bishops)
          -1 KBkn IMPOSSIBLE
          -2 KNkb IMPOSSIBLE
  -4 [] Positions that lead to 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3 but not need necessarily to lead
  to the three.
  - Until we prove 3.4 to exist we can't go further
